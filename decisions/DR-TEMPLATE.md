# A Decision Record Template

This can be a useful framework for recording decisions made by a group.
Based roughly on this [blog post](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). Absolutely feel free to deviate from this format if it makes sense for you.

Write as if you are having a conversation with a future developer who wonders why things are the way they are.

## Context
What is the issue we are seeing or design decision we are facing?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing?

## Also considered
What other options were there? Why were they rejected?

## Consequences
Positive, negative or neutral.
