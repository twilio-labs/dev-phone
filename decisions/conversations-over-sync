# Use Conversations instead of Sync

This can be a useful framework for recording decisions made by a group.
Based roughly on this [blog post](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). Absolutely feel free to deviate from this format if it makes sense for you.

Write as if you are having a conversation with a future developer who wonders why things are the way they are.

## Context
What is the issue we are seeing or design decision we are facing?
How do we best capture messaging interactions in the dev softphone? We need to have a small "history" that tracks the SMS conversation for inbound and outbound messages, and we need to render said messages in the UI

## Decision
Use Conversations. Don't have to ask questions about data structure

## Also considered
Sync was considered - Conversations is just a layer on top of Sync, and may not scale as well to complex future use cases, like multiple Conversations on the soft phone

## Consequences
Positive, negative or neutral.
